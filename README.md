## Description

This is a simple module for managing FreeBSD jails with ezjail admin.

It serves two purposes:  First, it's my first module built using the pdk.  Second, I make jails so infrequently I got tired of having to remember how to do it.  Yes, I know, ezjail is easy but I want to define my jails in puppet code and hiera data.

## Setup

### Beginning with ezjail

## Usage

## Reference

Users need a complete list of your module's classes, types, defined types providers, facts, and functions, along with the parameters for each. You can provide this list either via Puppet Strings code comments or as a complete list in the README Reference section.

* If you are using Puppet Strings code comments, this Reference section should include Strings information so that your users know how to access your documentation.

* If you are not using Puppet Strings, include a list of all of your classes, defined types, and so on, along with their parameters. Each element in this listing should include:

  * The data type, if applicable.
  * A description of what the element does.
  * Valid values, if the data type doesn't make it obvious.
  * Default value, if any.

## Limitations

This is only for FreeBSD.  It's the itch I want to scratch.

## Development

Not my day job, so development is sparse.  Bugs may not be quickly addressed.  Merge requests with fixes will get results faster.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**

Not on the forge yet.  Just started it so don't expect greatness.
